    <h2>Hey, I'm Vansh ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>
I am a product person who unexpectedly fell in love with gaming, retention curves, and monetization levers. When I am not shaping roadmaps or obsessing over metrics, youâ€™ll likely find me surfing, trekking, or chasing dopamine on a trail run.    </p>

    <p>
I played football at the highest level of youth competition (yes, real grass and real boots). While I didnâ€™t go pro, I still live and breathe sportâ€”football, cricket, running, swimming, tennis, you name it. Iâ€™m also a certified scuba diver and a bit of a weekend wave-chaser.    </p>

    <p>
Professionally, Iâ€™ve led teams and built features at Scopely, Dream11, and MPLâ€”working across everything from zero-to-one launches to scaled systems powering millions. I think in loops, experiment in sprints, and believe most problems can be solved with a little empathy and a whiteboard.    </p>

    <p>
      This site is my playground. Expect product thoughts, half-baked ideas, sharp breakdowns, and the occasional attempt at humor. If youâ€™re into games, systems, or just building cool stuffâ€”youâ€™ll probably feel at home here.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸ“¸ Fun Side Quest </h3>
    <p>
      When Iâ€™m not building or playing, I love capturing the little moments. Light, shadows, stories in silence. I donâ€™t claim to be a pro, but I click what I like. Check out some of my shots here:
