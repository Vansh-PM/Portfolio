    <h2>Hey, I'm Vansh ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>
      I am a product person who accidentally fell in love with gaming, retention curves, and monetization levers. When Iâ€™m not structuring Roadmaps or obsessing over Metrics, Iâ€™m probably either surfing, trekking, or chasing dopamine through a new trail run.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have played at the highest level of youth football (yes, actual real grass and boots!), and while I didnâ€™t go pro, I still live and breathe sportâ€”football, cricket, running, swimming, tennis, you name it. Iâ€™m also a <strong>certified scuba diver</strong> and a bit of a wave-chaser on the weekends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Professionally, Iâ€™ve led teams and built features at Scopely, Dream11, and MPLâ€”working on everything from zero-to-one launches to scaled systems that support millions. I think in loops, experiment in sprints, and believe most problems can be solved with a little empathy and a whiteboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is my playground. Expect random product thoughts, half-baked ideas, some serious breakdowns, and the occasional attempt at humor. If you're into games, systems, or just building cool thingsâ€”youâ€™ll probably feel at home here.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸ“¸ Fun Side Quest: Photography</h3>
    <p>
      When Iâ€™m not building or playing, I love capturing the little moments. Light, shadows, stories in silence. I donâ€™t claim to be a pro, but I click what I like. Check out some of my shots here:
